          <p class="lead">1500 Dragon Bone(s), 4 Quarter Key(s), 1 Tanem's Soul, 1 Hayashi's Soul, 1 Hatil's Soul, 1 Serra's Soul, 80 Dragoon's Essence(s), 1000 Mysterious Eye(s), 1 Cyrillius' Lance, 1 Lethailus' Pendant required. First head to Ryoko and find your way to the Dragon's Den. Now, collect 1500 Dragon Bone(s) either in the den or keep going north until you reach the trail and collect there. Kill Winged Dragon's or Cave Bat's. Once you have the Dragon Bones, You can trade them in for an Ivory Rod at Ryoko Camp inside the tent. (North/East ish when you've hit the Ryoko Trail.) Next head North/West and be prepared for the run threw the Ryoko Trail, to Ryoko Ruins then finally to Synical's Camp. Once you arrive at Synical's Camp you can either kill the Gate Keepers for a key drop, or run around the outskirts of the camp looking for a secret entrance inside. Once inside you need to kill the Lieutenant General(s) until  you get a Quarter Key drop, then use that key on the cabins with different coloured flags outside of them, to get to the bosses. Then kill each boss, for their soul drops.

            Tanem's, Hayashi's, Hatil's, and Serra's. Reminder: You need FOUR Quarter Keys to trade for further items so you might as well get those before proceeding. Now head back to where you traded the Dragon Bone(s) for the Ivory Rod and go left one map, inside the other tent and trade in all the needed items. If you traded them all in, you should now have an Entrance Key, now go back inside Synical's Camp and head North to the big tent, use the Entrance Key there and collect 80 Dragoon's Essence(s) from either the Lance Specialists or the Fallen Dragoons (Fallen Dragoons have a better rate, but they're both really crappy.) Once you have all those, head North until you reach the Janitor, now trade your Essence(s) for the Throne Opener, take your Throne Opener and use it on the blue door ahead of you. Inside is a boss named Lethailus you must kill him until he drops his Pendant, once you have that use the Pendant on the black tiles behind the thrones. Now you're in Aquias, the next three maps are tricky because there are various warps spread on the map, it'll take some time to figure out how the warps work.
            
            Once you're at the final map and you see two waterfalls, you can use your Pendant on the Water in the middle of the map, and head up into Cyrillus' Lair. Kill Cyrillus until he drops his Lance. Here you must hit the switches to get further. First go to the right pillar at the top of the map, use the Pendant there and walk onto the tile, now head over to the other pillar and go up then back down you will see a few helmets on the wall, enter the ones on the right side, left into the wall and up. Here's the Janitor again, now you must kill the Mysterious Hoods until you have 1000 Mysterious Eye(s) then trade them with the Janitor for the Synical Key. (Fyi; This hall is pretty tricky, it's a maze to get to the end;; you must go right up, right up.) Now use the Synical Key on the blue door and head into Synical's Lair kill Synical for the Final Soul. You can finally leave this place... run all the way back to Ryoko go to the map with the Grand Wyrm and you will see an entrance to a cliff, enter and trade all your items into Grazian, walk up to the wall on the right and use your Final Soul key on the wall, into another map with Grazian, trade the final soul and handle for the Soul Scythe. Congratz!</p>

          <p class="lead">900 Drumsticks, 1500 Dragonian Souls, 3500 Cantar Bones, 500 Starlit Ores, Ka Ru Claws, 250 Bomb Shelling required. To start Dragon Claws you first need to go to Kenshi which is located near the bottom left of the World Map. When you arrive at Kenshi you need to collect 900 Drumsticks from the Roruni Falcon which drop Drumsticks (3 per kill). After you have collected 900 you will need to find the stop inside the city of Kenshi and trade it for a Gate Key. After you have the use it to get to Kenshi Plains which is East of the city. You will then need to locate a big cave in the plains that is called 'Ka Ru'. Once you have entered you will need to collect 1500 Dragonian Soul(s) which is dropped by Bleak Spirit that drop 3 (rate 1/3). After you have collected it you will need to collect 3000 Cantar Bones which can be dropped by several npcs (Cantar Overlord, Cantar Berserker, Cantar Warrior). I would highly suggest you kill Cantar Overlord for the bones because it drop 6 (1/2) rate. After you are done, head to the Starlit Mines and collect 500 Starlit Ores (1/2 for 1). After you are done you will need to go back to Lair of Ka Ru and collect another 500 extra Cantar Bones.

            Then head to the city of Sel Crue, find the shop and trade 500 Cantar Bones and 250 Bomb Shelling (Which can be bought in the shop for 10k per) to get a 'Large Bomb.' Once you have done that head back to the lair and run to the end of the first part, there you will find a gate that will require a key (Large Bomb.) But beware during the run there is a map with 200 damage tiles so you will need to unequip and run accross to not get damage at all. Beyond the door of the first part, you will need to run the lair which is very difficult so I highly suggest you get a group to do the run. Once you get to the end you will need to fight the boss "Ka Ru" (Be very aware of the flame spirit, it hits HARD.) Ka Ru drops an item called 'Ka Ru Claws,' you will need to get two of them (1/40 rate). After you have succeeded getting the 2 drops you will need to head to Lu Thaye which is the island located just below Kenshi. From there you will need to run to the end of the island to find the shop and trade it in for your Dragon Claws. Congratulations you have completed the quest.</p>

            First thing you should do is go get a peice of time from the artifact of time npc. There spawn is changed once and a while, its random. So you have to find out from people where it spawns at a certain date.
            Then after you get that, or if you want to get that last, its up to you. Next what you should do is get someone to take you into Dark Forest. Inside the Dark Mines you need to collect 100 Brim stones.
            Once you do that, you go up to Mana village and collect 1300 Elemental Shards. Trade 1000 of them for a gate key, go up and use it on the door, go past the Fire guardian and use the key again on the door behind it. It will dissolve so be ready for whats behind the door. They have a strong attack.
            You may want to get a melee if you know a strong one to get you to the end of the maze and you can kill them easier. Collect 1750 of the Omni Stones. Once you have them, go back out the mountain, go down and collect 1000 Starlit Ores in Starlit mines.
            Then your almost done. At this point in time you should have 300 Elemental shards or 1300 if you skipped ahead, 1000 Starlit ores, 100 Brim stones, 1750 Omni stones and one Piece of time.
            Next take 50 Brimstones and 300 Elemental shards to Shinjoku, once you enter the town, where you see the shinjoku day/night guards, go right 1 map and into the shop to the left. Trade those for a Mystic Binder.
            Next exit the shop and go down 2 maps and right 1 map. You trade your Mystic Binder and your piece of time here for a Tome of Secrets.  After that, go to Sub Zero, the bottom middle map of the town, one above where Wendigos spawn, theres a shop there.
            Go into there and trade your 1000 Starlit Ores and your other 50 Brim Stones for a Purified Brim Stone. Trade your Purified Brim stone and the 1750 Omni Stones you collected for a Omni Rod.
            Last thing you need to do is collect 1000 more Elemental Shards or if you collected them earlier. Trade them in for another gate key. Now unless your a strong Defensive mage, you need a melee to get you to the last map of Omni golems. Here is where u trade your Tome of Secrets and the Omni Rod for Omni Staff!</p>

Collect 1000 of these.
            Once you do that, head towards the Great tree, its when you first enter Zhujin, head down a map, right a map, down and right, thats the great tree where you'll be doing the rest of the collecting for this quest.

            get through them and the kings potion is sitting on the chair, just pick it up and head back down out of the Royal Mansion.
            Once you exit the Mansion, head down a map and enter the left shop. Trade your 1000 Highland Spy Head(s) for a Seal of Approval.
            With the key, exit the shop, go down a map, you should see 4 different directions you can go. Go into the cave, this is where you trade the Seal of Approval for a Root Pass.
            Use the Root pass on the gate infront of you. This is where you collect the 2000 Germ Enzyme(s) from the Germs. They drop 1, Drop chance 1/2.
            Once that's collected, head back to the shop you traded the highland spy head(s) in at. Trade them for the Seal of Approval II.

            Go out the shop and back into the cave where you killed the germs and the Great infection. But instead of going right when you enter the cave and go up a map.
            Use the Level2 Root pass on the door at the top. The Snake Vines are what drops the Tough Vine(s), which you need 650 of and they drop them 1/3 and 1 at a time.

            Careful the Poisonous Air mist are attack on sight, and there's no warp back so you must make your way through the path. Before you enter the next map, trade your Kings Potion and Letter of Approval here for a Grand Root Key.
            Once you get past all of them you should be back to where you trade in the Seals for Root Passes. Head back into the cave where you killed the Hydro Vines. One map below that there is a gate to your left.
            Head to the end and you'll see a Great Germ if its spawned. Its a night/day spawn but its important to kill it. Once you kill it, you'll get warped to the final place.
            Go up a map and trade in your Grand root key and Great root Pass for a Kings seal, and your Level2 Root Key and Root Pass for the kings paper then finally go around to the door and into the door.
