First, go and mine 500 Iron Ore from Nara Mines and trade them in at the Nara Weapon Shop for an Iron Key. Go to the Scientists house, located North West of Haven, and exit of of his house to the right. Use the Iron Key (Doesn't dissolve) on the barrels blocking your path to get inside the Underground Lab. This whole place is a red zone, and you can't exit unless you get to the end, so watch out. Now, kill the Cyborgs for Power Cores, 600 are needed. Now, go to the Nara Weapons shop, and use the Iron Key on the door at the back, (Doesn't dissolves) which opens it.. Then, if you want, you can trade your 600 power cores and Iron Key for a Styx Blade, or you can do it later. Once you have done all these, you can carry on.
            Next, go to Underworld which is located North West of Sub Zero.
            To get into the Underworld, you will need a Hachiman Jinpachi, which you trade for an Olympian Medal. Next, go down inside and collect 750 Soul Bottles, which are dropped from Soul Takers. Watch out for the damage tiles down there, you can cancel them out with a Divine Plate though. Or, you can attempt to take on the Grand Tormenter, who drops a Bonding Material, but is very hard and the drop isn't good. Either way you decide to go, once you have 750 Soul Bottles, go back out and trade them along with the Olympian Medal for a bonding material at the entrance. If you got the Bonding Material drop, you won't need to do this.
            Next, go and get a Murky Stone and 5 Red Shining Ore. Trade them for a Good Map at Nara Swamps, East of the Bog Beast map. Trade the Good Map for a Rusty Pick at the bottom house in Shinjoku. Now, go to the Nara Caverns, located past the red zone Fairies and inside the cave. Use the rusty pick (Dissolves), on the rock at the top left of the map, to open the door into the Golem area.Inside here are 2 Golems that either drop Mechanical Hearts or Master Blue Prints (Summon Golem quest). Once you have 65 Mechanical Hearts, go back to the Scientists House, and trade them in for a Sparkling Gem. Take the Sparkling Gem to  the Shinjoku Inn and trade it for a Green Card. Take the Green Card to the Shinjoku Fight Club and use it on the middle door (Dissovles). Kill the Thief Lord Zelai in there and he will drop a Wind Cutter. Once you have a Wind Cutter, take that to the house in Shinjoku and trade it for a Hero's Medal. Then, travel to Nara, and go trade your Hero's Medal along with 500 Wyrm eggs at the little boy's house for a Styx Hilt. Head back to the Nara Weapon Shop, and behind the door again. Trade your Styx Hilt and Styx Blade for Weakened Styx. Trade the Weakened Styx and Bonding Material for a Styx. Congratulations.</p>

This is where the run begins. If you clear the run, you'll find yourself at the Dark Fortress entrance. If you can't borrow a key from a friend, you must collect the 300 Chipped Armors from the map left of the Fortress. One map right of the Fortress entrance is the Shadow Cave, where you must collect 300 Shadow Eyes. Once you have 300 of both, go to the Magic Shop in Shinjoku, next to the casino. Here trade the Armors and Eyes for a Dark Fortress Opener. Make your way back to the Fortress entrance, and use your key on the door. (Doesn't dissolve)Now you're inside, you can obtain the rest of the stuff. Start with the Warrior Bones, which are on the right hand side, dropped from Warrior's Corpses. If you go passed the Warrior's Corpses, and follow the path to the end, you'll encounter a boss, who drops Ring of Promise. Be prepared, she hits quite hard. Once you've collected the 100 Warrior Bones and got your Ring of Promise drop, head to the left hand side, where you will find Shaded Souls. These drop Soul Decays, of which you will need 100 of also. This side's a little more tricky to get to the boss, since they are attack on site, and have several different ways to go. When you pass a few maps, there should be a crossroads, where you must take the top path, and follow it on. Eventually you'll reach the boss, who drops a Key Mould. Once again, lookout as he hits pretty damn hard. Once you have the Key Mould, Ring of Promise, 100 Bones and Soul Decays, head back to the middle room. Here you need to trade the 100 Soul Decays and Bones for a Key Material. Then trade the Key Material and Key Mould for a Crypt Key, which allows you access to the upper levels. After you've entered the Crypt, you'll encounter Anguished Souls, which drop Trapped Souls. You will need 100 of these for an item needed at the final trade in. On the second Anguished Soul map, use your Ring of Promise on the wall to enter Empowered Cain's domain. He drops a Body of Evil, again he hits mega hard and also watch out for the Shadow Minions who are attack on site. Once you have the Body of Evil, head back to the Soul map, and go up the stairs. Here you'll find the Fire Beasts, and one more map up, Dark Imp Spirits. These will drop the Beast Souls and Imp Spirits, which you need 50 of each to trade in for a Beast Cage Key. Use the key on the northern door (does not dissolve) and head up a map into the room, and here you'll find Dark Dragon. Kill him for a Dark Dragon's Soul. Now head back to the middle room, with the Sacrifical Plaque shop. Trade your 100 Trapped Souls for an Oversoul. Then trade your Oversoul + Dark Dragons Soul for a Dark Oversoul. Now trade the Dark Oversoul and Body of Evil for a Emperor's Body.You should still have your Crypt Key on you, so make your way back up to the stairs. Take a right here, and carry on 2 maps and you should come to a set of doors. Use your Dark Emperor's Body on the door to open it. (Doesn't dissolve). Here you have to trade your Beast Cage Key and Ring of Promise for a Dark Vortex Opener which gives you access to the Dark Emperor's room, 1 map above. Enter the above room, and you'll see the Dark Emperor along with more Shadow Minions. Once you've killed the Dark Emperor, he'll drop a Dark Emperor's Cloth. Run into the upper parts of his throne to warp out. Now you have to trade your Dark Vortex Opener + Crypt Key for a Chaos Core. Also, trade the Dark Emperor's Cloth and Emperor's body for a Bottle of Screams. FINALLY; trade the Bottle Of Screams and Chaos Core in for your Chaos Blade. Congratulations.</p>
