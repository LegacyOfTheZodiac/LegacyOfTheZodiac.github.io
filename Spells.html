    <h1 class="display-5">Summon Iris</h1>
    <p class="lead">Dwarven Site Key, Missing Statue Piece, 4500 Bead(s) of Dread, 100 Lost Soul(s), 7000 Bottle(s) of Screams, 5000 Restless Soul(s), 100 Guardian Skulls, Rusty Key, Lucifer's Seal required. To start collecting for Summon Iris you need to buy a Dwarven Site key for 50 million gold. The shop is located in the East, all the way northeast of Shinjoku. Once you buy the Dwarven Site Key you can use it on the mining cart to get into the cave to buy the Missing Statue Piece, which is used to get into the Ancient Crypt. Now you need to get to 'Beneath the Tree...' located directly south of the Alkanor entrance. Here you will use the Missing Statue piece to get into the Ancient Crypt where you begin collecting for Summon Iris. When you enter the Ancient Crypt you will see Tainted Crypt Souls. The map to the left will have the Wandering Soul and the Empty Box on the map. You will need to kill 100 Wandering Souls in order to get the Magical Statue Opener that unlocks the switch to the door Empty Box is behind. The map to the right will have a Tiny Spring in the back. You can get it easily with two people, or kill the Tainted Crypt Souls and try to get it before they respawn.
      Trade in the Magical Statue Opener and the Empty Box for a Broken Music Box. Trade in the Broken music Box and the Tiny Spring for a Music Box. Collect 4500 Bead(s) of Dread from the Tainted Crypt Souls for the Small Silver Key to move to the next area. When you get to the next area you will see Shrieking Dead. You will need to collect 7000 Bottle(s) of screams from them for a Tainted Key. Once you have the Tainted Key go through the gates and left. Follow the path until you get to Crypt Lurkers. You will need to collect 5000 Restless Soul(s) from Crypt Lurkers for a Restless Manifest. Once you have the Restless Manifest you can use it on the crystals below the Tainted gate. Follow the path down to Guard of the Dead. You will need to collect 100 Guardian Skull(s) from them to buy a Statue Breaker. Once you have the Statue Breaker you can use it on the statues blocking the entrance to the cave on Guard of the Dead's map. Be careful when you enter the cave because Lucifer's Minion hits hard, and there is a chance they can spawn right by the entrance.
      They are 1 hittable even with a melee attack. They drop a Rusty Key which is used to get into Lucifer's Chamber. Once you get into Lucifer's Chamber you can kill Lucifer until he drops Lucifer's Seal. Once you finally have Lucifer's Seal you can leave the crypt. At anytime after you complete the quest you can type /craftbookofiris to create the spellbook. You will need to have the following items in your inventory when you type in the command: Dwarven Site Key, Music Box, Small Silver Key, Tainted Key, Restless Manifest, Statue Breaker, Lucifer's Seal and then boom congratz you now have Summon Iris :)</p>

    <p class="lead">Unholy Chambers Key, Holy Jail Key, 2664 Broken Hopes, 800 Dark Paladin Blades required. You should start by getting the Unholy Chambers key, which drops from the Paladin Lord located in the south-east castle. Once you have that, go down into the church dungeons and run to the end of the path. You'll find the Holy Jailer, this guy drops the Holy Jail Key. When you have that drop, go right a map, and you'll see the Dark Paladin's and Damned Clerics. Go right again and use your key on the door (Doesn't dissolve) and go up. This is a better room for collecting. Kill both groups of enemies until you have the required ammounts of items. Once you have everything, go into the Holy Chambers, take the right path to the end, and trade in your goods for Divine Strike.</p>
